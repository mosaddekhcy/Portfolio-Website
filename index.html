      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah (SWT) be upon you. I am a passionate and detail-oriented Web Developer with a proven track record of building dynamic, responsive, and user-centric web applications. My goal is to combine creativity, functionality, and efficiency in every project I undertake.

What sets me apart is my perseverance—I never quit when faced with challenges. I thrive on learning new skills and technologies, which allows me to adapt and innovate in an ever-evolving tech landscape. Though I consider myself a bit lazy in the traditional sense, this trait inspires me to think outside the box and find smarter, more efficient solutions to complex problems.

Beyond coding, I am a lifelong learner dedicated to honing my craft and creating meaningful digital experiences. Let's work together to turn ideas into impactful solutions!
